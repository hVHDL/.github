hlsVHDL project has a collection of open source libraries written to be used as git submodules in any (V)HDL project. The code is written using as high level of abstraction as possible for synthesis. The coding style and modules allow for sharing and reusing the code that goes into the IP components. The different repositories are used separately, thus if fixed point math library is needed, the just clone the math library.

High level synthesis with VHDL (hlsVHDL) is a set of coding patterns which aims to greatly increase abstraction and support for incremental design, testing and development of the synthesizable VHDL source code. All code has been synthesized with Xilinx Vivado, ISE, Intel Quartus or Efinix Efinity and rtl is being simulated using GHDL.

Code in all modules is used through an abstracted interface with subroutines. Code is written using records to specify the registers and a procedure is used to create the logic for the registers as well as accessing the functionality. Most code is thus used with just a signal of module record type and subroutines that then take this signal as argument.
