High level synthesis with VHDL (hlsVHDL) is a set of coding patterns which aims to greatly increase abstraction and support for incremental design, testing and development of the synthesizable VHDL source code.

hlsVHDL project has a collection of open source libraries written to be used as git submodules in any (V)HDL project. The code is written using as high level of abstraction as possible for synthesis. The coding style and modules allow for sharing and reusing the code that goes into the IP components.

Code has been successfully tested with Xilinx Vivado, ISE, Intel Quartus and Efinix Efinity and rtl is being simulated using GHDL
